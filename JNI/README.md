QT:

QT is a cross platform development tool. Widely used for developing applications that can run on various platforms.
 
pros:
1. Provides a set of libraries(STL, boost) contatining many APIs.
2. QT provides best GUI.
3. QT performance is better(since code is compiled to native binaries).
4. Open source, Portable, Flexible.

cons:
1. requires lot of disc space.
2. Its huge, requires more time to understand each bit.

JNI:

JNI is Java Native interface. It is a programming framework that enables java code running in JVM to call/called by  native applications/libraries written in C/C++.
(It defines a way for Java programming code to interact with Native code(C/C++)).

pros:
1. Adds performance boost to application
2. Using existing libraries.

cons:
1. Code debug is big overhead.
2. looses platform portability that java offers.


NDK: Native Development Kit

Generally Android applications are developed in Java. Specifically with ANdroid Software development kit(SDK).
NDK, allows developers to use natively-compiled libraries written in C/C++ within there java application to enhance performance.
The main advantage of NDK is to port C/C++ code to Android without rewrite it all in Java.
